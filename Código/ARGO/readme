With this readme file you will know how to run the same experiments that are presented in the paper.

The process to run the experiments is the follow:

1) Install all NEAT, HyperNEAT and TauHyperNEAT libraries.
2) Start vrep or vreps.
3) Execute TauHyperNEAT or HyperNEAT experiments. 
4) Read the experiments results.

IMPORTANT: ONLY FOR LINUX, TESTED IN UBUNTU AND LINUX MINT 


1) Install all NEAT, HyperNEAT and TauHyperNEAT libraries.
=========================================================

For this purpose is created the Install_all_libraries.sh file that you have to run with 

> chmod 755 *.sh  
> sudo bash Install_all_libraries.sh


2) Start vrep or vreps.
======================

The experiment is thinked to execute many vreps in the same computer (we recommend do not use more than 50% of the cpu because that can interfere with simulation calculus) 

For run many vrep we have the run_Vreps.sh file that you have to run with

> bash run_Vreps.sh firstPort numberOfVrepsToExecute

for example 

> bash run_Vreps.sh 19993 5

This means that you want 5 vreps with the ports 19993, 19994, 19995, 19996, 19997 for attend experiments.

Nota that the ports that you decide here HAVE TO BE  de same that the port you will indicate to your experiment to use, that is because your experiments will think that exist vreps in waiting for instructions.

IS IMPORTANT SEE IF ALL IS OK, PROBABLY SOME WARNINGS CAN APPEAR BUT NOTHING IMPORTANT.


3) Execute TauHyperNEAT or HyperNEAT experiments.
================================================

As said before we have to said wich ports are waiting for experiment instructions. You can elect to experiment with HyerperNEAT or TauHyperNEAT

Elect the correspond .sh (run_HyperNEAT_experiment.sh o run_TauHyperNEAT_experiment.sh). You have to run with, for example,


run_TauHyperNEAT_experiment.sh firstPort numberOfVrepsWaiting

Following the before example,

> bash run_TauHyperNEAT_experiment.sh 19993 5


4) Read the experiments results.
================================

With the run_TauHyperNEAT_experiment.sh you will see inside the correspond experiment folder this folder a new folder named saved_trains_... that  will have all information that emerges from the experiments, the most important files are ./simulation_files/{fitness, min_files}.txt

 ./simulation_files/fitness.txt: will have the mean of the fitness per generation.

 the format is

 generation    meanOfTheGeneration    StandartDeviation


 ./simulation_files/min_files.txt: remeber that the final fitness is the minimum in between distance_fitness and frequency_fitness, this file have the AmounFitnessWithDistanceFitnessLikeTheMinimumFitness and in other column the AmounFitnessWithFrequencyFitnessLikeTheMinimumFitness

 the format is 

 generation    AmounFitnessWithDistanceFitnessLikeTheMinimumFitness     AmounFitnessWithFrequencyFitnessLikeTheMinimumFitness
